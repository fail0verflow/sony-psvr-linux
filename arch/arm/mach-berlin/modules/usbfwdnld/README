1) FOR DRIVER BUILD

	Goto source code directory usbfwdnld_src/.
	make [clean] build
	The driver binary can be found in ../bin_usbfwdnld directory.
	The driver code supports Linux kernel up to 3.2.

2) FOR DRIVER INSTALL

	a) Copy firmware image usb8766_uapsta.bin | ... to /lib/firmware/mrvl/ directory,
	   create the directory if it doesn't exist.

	b) Install USB FW download driver
		The module takes two optional parameters -

		1) fw_name=<FW name>
			This paramter supplies the name of the FW to be downloaded. If this parameter
			is not provided, the default FW is loaded.

			For example, to download FW with USB8766 adapter,
				insmod usbfwdnld.ko [fw_name=mrvl/usb8766_uapsta.bin]

		2) req_fw_nowait=0|1
			This parameter instructs the module to load the FW using either
			request_firmware API (blocking call) or request_firmware_nowait (non-blocking call)

			0: use request_firmware API (default)
			1: use request_firmware_nowait API

		Note: On some platforms (e.g. PXA910/920) double quotation marks ("") need to used
		for module parameters.
			insmod sd8xxx.ko "<para1> <para2> ..."

	c) Uninstall WLAN driver,
		rmmod usbfwdnld

3) OPERATION

	The USB FW download driver is designed to only download the FW to the adapter.
	The driver is NOT a fully operation WLAN/BT driver and will not create network
	interfaces upon loading.

	It is expected to be followed by the regular WLAN/BT driver loading, which performs
	all WLAN/BT related operations, but will skip the FW download. For details on how to
	build and load regular WLAN/BT driver please refer to README of the respective driver.
